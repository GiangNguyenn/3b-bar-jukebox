# How to Play: Music Connections

Welcome to **Music Connections**, a competitive jukebox game where you and a friend battle to influence the music queue. Your goal is to navigate the playlist from the current song to your secret **Target Artist**—before your opponent does!

## The Objective

You are assigned a **Target Artist** (e.g., _Taylor Swift_ or _Metallica_).
Every turn, you'll choose the next song. Your aim is to pick tracks that are _musically similar_ or _connected_ to your target, steering the playlist closer and closer until your artist finally plays.

## The Game Loop

### 1. Song Plays

The game begins with a random song. This is your starting point.

### 2. Make Your Move (60 Seconds)

When it's your turn, you are presented with **9 song choices**. You have **60 seconds** to decide. The timer starts **as soon as the choices appear**.

- **If you pick**: The song is queued, and you gain/lose influence based on your choice.
- **If time runs out**: You miss your turn! No song is queued. When the current track finishes it becomes the next players turn.

Use your musical intuition to pick the best path. **After you choose**, the game reveals how well you did:

- **[CLOSER]**: Good job! This song is musically similar to your Target Artist. You gain **Influence** (Gravity).
- **[NEUTRAL]**: Staying the course. You get a small Influence boost.
- **[FURTHER]**: Oops. This song moved away from your target. You _lose_ Influence!

### 3. Steer the Vibe

The song you pick becomes the _new_ starting point for the next round.

- _Example:_ If your target is **Nirvana** and the current song is by _Pop Smoke_, you might pick _The Weeknd_ -> _Michael Jackson_ -> _Queen_ -> _Foo Fighters_ -> **Nirvana**.

### 4. Taking Turns

Turns switch automatically **every time a new song starts**.

- It doesn't matter who picked the song (or if it was a random autoplay).
- If you **Skip a Song** (via Spotify or the player controls), the game treats it as the song ending. The turn immediately passes to the other player on the new track!
- **New Song = New Turn**. Simple as that!

### 5. Scoring & New Rounds

You score a point when **Your Target Artist plays!**

When someone scores:

1.  **Point Awarded**: The winner gets +1 to their score.
2.  **New Targets**: Both players are assigned **brand new** Target Artists.
3.  **Reset**: Gravity and round counters reset.
4.  **Game Continues**: The battle starts fresh with the current song!

### 6. The Endgame (Round 10+)

If nobody has won by Round 10, the game enters **High Stakes Mode**.
In this mode, the game engine aggressively tries to find your Target Artist. If you've built up enough Influence, your target is almost guaranteed to appear in the choices!

### 6. Difficulty Modes

You can adjust the challenge level at any time:

- **Easy**: Shows **Title, Artist, Album, Genre, and Popularity**. Perfect for learning the music connections.
- **Medium** (Default): Shows **Title and Artist**. The standard challenge.
- **Hard**: Shows **Title ONLY**. The ultimate test of your music knowledge—can you recognize the artist just by the song name?

## Tips for Success

- **Watch Your Gravity**: High gravity means the game engine "listens" to you more, offering better shortcuts to your target. Low gravity means you'll have to take the long way around.

## Changing Targets

You can change your **Target Artist** at any time. However, this comes at a cost:

- **Influence Reset**: Your gravity will reset to the starting level.
- **Round Reset**: The current round counter will restart.
  Use this only if you feel your current target is impossible to reach from the current song!
